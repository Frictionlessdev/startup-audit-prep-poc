Use Case Breakdown
A SaaS firm needs SOC 2 for enterprise clients but lacks dedicated compliance teams. Sprinto ingests configs from tools (e.g., IAM policies from Okta, logs from CloudWatch), auto-maps to 60+ controls, flags gaps, and generates audit-ready reports. Engineers spend 80% less time; auditors verify in days. Real example: Ripl achieved SOC 2 in weeks post-integration.

POC Design Goals
Build a minimal Sprinto-like POC to demo SOC 2 prep for 5 key controls (e.g., logical access, change management). Use mock integrations, auto-mapping logic, and a dashboard. Target: Simulate 25-day readiness in minutes, proving 3x speedup.
